I’ve had this bass for a very long time and it’s been my most comfortable bass. I’m getting into a project that is pretty hard rock-ish, and I’m stepping into new ground a bit by having a lot of the music be bass-focused (a la Primus.kinda). To that point, I’m hoping to get a bit of a more beefy, almost crunchy tone out of the Warwick, namely because it is my preferred

Hey, so I recently bought a sansamp bass driver as I started filling in for my friends band who play hardcore/punk music. I sold my last head and in the meantime I’m using my old ampeg b2re that’s been sitting in my basement for a few years now (not ideal but trying to make it work while I search for a new head). When I was practicing the other day I noticed that the clip/peak light was blinking quite a bit on my head even when I turned it down to the point where everyone else could barely.

I've been playing guitar for 15 years, but just starting getting into bass. I picked up a SansAmp Bass Driver DI (V1), and I have no idea how to set this thing! Specifically, the Phantom amp Ground Connect switch, the Line Inst Output switch, and the Line Inst XLR switch. amp#x200B; I will be using this as the last pedal in my chain, primarily for recording and as a DI box when necessary. I intend to run the output into the front of my amp in a live setting, and also the XLR output 
Enjoy the lowest prices and best selection of Bass Effects Pedals at Guitar Center. Most orders are eligible for free shipping. Hi all, Probably my favorite pedal on my bass pedalboard is my SansAmp Bass Driver. I love it as a pre-amp and for tone shaping and it's essentially an always on pedal for me. Other than that, the D.I. output on the pedal is very useful for home recording. I run an XLR into my mic/line preamp and then into my computer and I get a great sound. There seems to be tons of options for this type of pedal designed for bass (MXR M80/M81, Tech21 SansAmps, TC SpectraDrive, a bunch of Darkglass pedals). Although we might take some flak from guitarists, we bassists know the truth: a band just wouldn't be the same without the deep, rumbling tones of the bass laying the foundation for everyone. Please excuse the lack of knowledge here. Wondering if I could run into a PA via the XLR and to an Amp via the 1/4" output (as opposed to the Parallel Output - I want to keep the tone shaping) at the same time? Would I use the -20db XLR pad and the +10db 1/4" boost options together? Not sure if they control the outputs individually or if it affects the output overall. Thanks. type: preamp features: boost switch for solos, bass and treble EQ, sweepable notch filter for feedback suppression, character control, latency less than 1ms, 1/4″ pickup input/high impedance (1MΩ), XLR DI output, XLR mic input with 48V phantom supply (used for training the Tone Dexter). 
Early life. Francis Charles Joseph Bello is the nephew of Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante.Bello had a younger brother Anthony, who was murdered in the Bronx, New York City, on March What's people's opinion on on this pedal? It seems a little pricey but I've heard lots of reviews, is there any other similar pedals I could check. One of the selling points of the V2 sansamp bass driver is it's more "friendly" for 5/6 strings. I have a 6 string bass and someone has offered a Sansamp Bass Driver (v1) for my helicon gxt harmony pedal. How do these work on 6 string basses? (The v1) Let me know because i don't want ot get an unusable pedal. mainly looking for clean boosts and bass ODs. EQD Arrows? OCDs? eh eh? can you feel that? ah shit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMj2jlYIc_0. I bought a new fuzz pedal and I have no idea if I should put the fuzz after the sansamp or before. 
Tape Delay sold. Thanks for the offers everyone. Dunes still available. I recently ordered a SamsAmp Bass Driver for gigs where I need to go direct, but I also plan to use it with my Fender Rumble 200 to improve the tone. I've seen it thrown out there that I could use the effects loop instead of the normal input if I want to bypass the Rumble's preamp, but I'm not sure whether or not to do that. Below is my signal chain: TunergtAutoWahgtCompressorgtBass ODgtChorusgtDelaygtSansAmp Any advice is appreciated. So yeah I have those two up for trade, the micro synth has a bent dial on the rate channel but it works fine. I’m looking for a Tech 21 Fly Rig or a Tech 21 RBI (but the microsynth is out of the deal and I’ll throw down cash or a Rolls SX21 Tiny 2 way Crossover) Or something similar, i’m open to suggestions. 
Looking for a bass compressor, or any other effects (I'm open minded) Hey r/bass! So I recently got myself an Ampeg BA-210 and I'm in love. I can get some really great tones out of it and it's plenty loud enough for my needs. Anyway, one of the most useful features is the DI out, which eliminates the need for a dedicated DI box. I was going to buy myself a SansAmp Bass Driver at some point but given that the amp sounds good and has a DI I was wondering whether I'd need to buy one at all? Most bassists absolutely swear by their SansAmps and say it's an almost. Hey guys, I was recently fortunate enough to come into the possession of both of these pedals and I need your help deciding which one to keep. I'm a guitarist, but I use bass when I'm writing and recording. I usually just DI into my audio interface and it sounds acceptable, but I've been trying both of these out and the difference is pretty astounding - they make my shitty bass sound much more professional. I was going to sell both of them, but now I feel like one bass DI box is probably With my band we are planning to do some home recording and the current DI box we have is starting to crap out. I have read up on the reviews of this pedal but I thought I might as well check with all you bass folk here to see if anyone has any thoughts. I am looking to purchase a pedal/DI combo and was wondering if this is a good choice or if I should look into something else. Thanks. 
I'm considering picking up one of these bad boys. I only have a few gigs a year where I run directly into a PA, and I think the SansAmp would be a great solution to let me tweak the tone and get a nice balanced signal in those situations. My question is this: I know some people like to use them with their amps too, and most of my gigging is through amps. Would I get value out of the SansAmp for those gigs too? Would you buy one specifically to use with an amp or would that be a waste? Thanks. I'm gonna be investing in one of these pedals. I was sold on the BDD initially, I basically wanted it to be my always on with various tones for different styles and a couple different levels of grit saved. Doing research I'm seeing many people recommend the VT Bass Deluxe saying it is way more versatile than the BDD. I play a jazz bass into a fender rumble 500 in a hard rock band. I keep my tone fairly bright and punchy and use some fuzz and chorus occasionally. I'm looking for multiple tones. ( I play mostly Alternative branching into rock with my Fender Aerodyne Jazz Bass. I've been looking into getting a pre-amp or a pedal. I used the SansAmp direct box at a show we played and I really liked the sound I got from it. So what are you opinions on the SansAmp line and have any of you guys used them before? Edit: Also how does the Bass Driver Programmable (http. Does having the mid control make a big difference? I'm thinking of the getting the programmable version but it has no mid control. The vt version seems cool but I want the presence knob. I want to get rancid/Green Day tones out of it. I was hoping the programmable would let me switch between that to a more vintage tone and then to a distorted tone. Any advice. </p>
