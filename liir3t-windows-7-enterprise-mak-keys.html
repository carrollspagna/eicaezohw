Update 10/25/2010: This article is superseded by Activate Windows 7 Enterprise with a MAK Key - GUI Method. A small customer purchased Software Assurance. Computers that are running volume licensed editions of Windows Server, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 are, by default Or will we have to re-image these devices?

Some history: Currently we deploy Windows 10 Pro using a MAK key from the M$ VLSC. We recently purchased an E3 Enterprise agreement that is user subscription based through Azure. The machine then auto upgrades to Enterprise after a few logins/reboots from a user that has been synced to Azure (via AD Connect). My question is, how do I handle this in MDT? I know I could use the Enterprise flavor of the OS from the same ISO, but if I want to move away from using Программа Microsoft Toolkit для Windows бесплатно, скачать на русском Ключ активации windows 10 enterprise mak: bnj87-jyh2b-dgxwm-jjvmr-q9mpf не успела выйти новая ос от как почти мгновенно появился. 
 Separate KMS keys will be issued for each product key grouping, meaning that a customer will have access to a KMS key for Client VL for both Windows 7 and Windows Vista. The KMS key for the newer Windows products will also activate the previous generation, meaning that a customer can have a single KMS key to activate multiple editions and generations of Windows. I'm working on a proposal for a full refresh for a law-firm client I have been supporting.

So, I'm wanting to get my office on Win 10 Enterprise Our office is a small LLC, let's call it OFFICE01. About 30 users. BUT, we are owned by BIG-CORP, of about 30,000 users. All users of OFFICE01 are on the BIG-CORP AD structure/domain with O365. (But no Win 10 ENT licenses). BIG-CORP has decided to go the route of WIN 10 PRO, and if individual offices wish to procure Win 10 ENT on their own, they are free to do so. (Don't get me started on when I think this is a terrible decision).

Hey All, We're having an issue installing the creator update on any of our Enterprise edition VMs. We grabbed the ISO from the portal, but when installing it fails at validating the product key (which is either from our KMS, or our org's valid MAK). We don't see the same issue on physical laptops. My guess here is that the updater is checking the BIOS/UEFI to see if there is a windows license burned in, and failing on that, which is why the physical laptops work.

I don't see any KMS keys, and when I opened the "Keys and Downloads" for Windows 10 enterprise it told me to contact the volume licensing help center. After I did they provided me only with a MAK key. We're trying to prep for possible Win 10 upgrades for a few of our staff and possibly growing 
If I'm activating Enterprise with a MAK key online, and not against a local KMS server, would it basically be the same as Ultimate with a RTL key? Or does the MAK key provide unlimited activations for multiple machines? I'm just trying to understand the differences, to see if it would. I spent hours today trying to figure out how to do this, with no luck. Basically, when I try to install Windows 8.1 onto this laptop, it automatically pulls the keys from UEFI, regardless of what media I use, and installs non-pro Windows. I have also tried including a PID.txt file in /sources with the MAK license key in it, that didn't work. Anytime upgrade won't accept the key, neither will just changing the key from the system window. Has anyone done this successfully before? You cannot enter a license key during installation when installing Windows 7 Enterprise. That's why it will automatically try to locate a KMS in your network after installation. I just took over managing a dev/test environment and I wanted to know how others handle the windows licensing issues. The VMs run on ESXi or Hyper-V, depending on what people need.
